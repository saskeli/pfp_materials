    "\n",
    "In this assignment you are expected to implement various versions of VByte encoding, and to benchmark these using the data you create (with `nums.py` or otherwise).\n",
    "\n",
    "**VByte** encoding is a famous compression scheme for integers that is used for efficiency in many software systems, including search engines. A brief description of VByte encoding is given in the \"Description of VByte encoding\" document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The intent is to create the tooling necessary to benchmark VByte coding. The executable should initially take as a parameter only a file, and if no file is given, should read from the standard input. In addition, arguments `-s` and `-k <num>` may be given. The program should work as follows:\n",
    "* Read $n$ from file or standard input\n",
    "* Read $n$ 64-bit integers from file or standard input and store the integers using VByte coding.\n",
    "    * If `-s` was given, input is sorted and differences between integers should be stored instead of the integers themselves.\n",
    "    * If `-k <num>` was given, generalized VByte code with $k$ bit blocks should be used.\n",
    "* Output the number of blocks used for encoding the input to `std::cerr`.\n",
    "* Output the contents of the data structure (as text). I.e. repeat back the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** For B series task, you will not be able to simply read the entire input into a vector or array first before encoding, as this will take too much space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example with input: $[2, 7, 500]$<br/>\n",
    "The program should output: $[3, 7, 500]$<br/>\n",
    "I.e. 3 VByte blocks were used and the numbers were $7$ and $500$.\n",
    "\n",
    "And later when random access is supported:<br/>\n",
    "For input: $[2, 7, 500, 2, 1, 0]$<br/>\n",
    "The program should output: $[3, 500, 7]$<br/>\n",
    "I.e. again 3 blocks used and `VB.get(1)` $= 500$, `VB.get(0)` $= 7$. "

    "\n",
    "Implement a VByte encoding based data structure (`VByte.hpp` for example). Implement code to use the data structure as described above. Random access is not required yet for this task. The `-k` flag will also not be present yet, and can safely be ignored here. You can simply assume that k = 7, and use full bytes with an included stop bit. Any index queries at the end of test data files can also be ignored for now.\n",

Measure also the time taken for reading and encoding separately from the time used for outputting. Test different approaches to reading the input data. What do you find? While you were developing your encoding and decoding routines, were you able to improve (or worsen) runtimes? If so, what changes made a difference? How can you divide (and compute modulus) by powers of 2 quickly? How can this be exploited in VByte encoding? Does this matter for this task?\n",

Making use of your solution for Packed Integer Arrays from Assignment 2, implement a generalised version of VByte codes where the number of data bits can be specified as a parameter, $k$. That is, the argument `-k <num>`.\n",
