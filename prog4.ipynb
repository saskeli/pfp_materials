We can locate the relevant bits in $A_1$ by calculating the number of 0s up to and including position $i$ in $B_0$ --- observe that the number of 0s up to position $i$ is $y = i - \\operatorname{sum}(i)$. This means $A_1[y]$ is the next part of the code (spend a minute verifying this to yourself with an example). If $B_1[y] = 1$ we are finished. Otherwise ($B_1[y] = 0$) there are yet more parts of the code, and we can locate the next of those parts at the next layer (Layer 2) using a similar (i.e. sum-based) approach."
