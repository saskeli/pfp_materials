    "\n",
    "In this exercise set we continue working with data structures for non-negative integer set supporting insertion and membership queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "As previously:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We want a program that can store non-negative integers and tells us if a given integer is stored or not. \n",
    "* When the program is started we can insert non-negative integers or switch to query mode by entering a negative integer. \n",
    "* In query mode, entering a non-negative integer, tells us if the integer is stored or not and entering a negative integer switches back to insert mode.\n",
    "* The program is terminated with a keyboard interrupt (CTRL+C) or when EOF is reached for file input.\n",
    "* We should be able to tell the program to use specific set data structures, give an optional upper limit for integer size, tell the program something about how the data is entered.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are looking for fast implementations that do not consume significantly more space than `std::set` or `std::unordered_set`."

    "Use the template project from last week.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ran the program with a good combination of data structure types and test data variations, you will have noticed that “-t 2”, the one that uses `std::unordered_set` is fastest in all cases. The task here is to beat it for cases where the insertions and queries are not interleaved.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data structure does not have to be ready for queries before the first query is encountered, and this “query readiness” does not have to be maintained when new insertions are encountered.\n",
    "\n",
    "The phases of the program could be as follows:\n",
    "* Start in insert mode. Store new insertions as fast as possible with no regard for query performance.\n",
    "* Once the first query is encountered, convert the structure to one that supports very fast queries, but not fast insertions.\n",
    "* Serve queries using this converted structure very quickly.\n",
    "* Since we know the input is not interleaved, we don’t even need to consider changing back to “fast insert mode” (though this is trivial for the solution we have in mind)\n",
    "\n",
    "Your data structure should not require more space than `std::unordered_set`.\n",
