    "Efficient manipulation of individual bits is a key aspect of space-efficient data structures that are used in \n",
    "systems in which memory is at a premium. For example, the intersection algorithms that are at the core of modern search engines do extensive bit manipulation. So do the data compressors used in modern database systems. So too do DNA read-mapping pipelines used in the study of genomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the programming assignment you are required to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement a `BitArray` class that provides methods to set and unset bits in an array of $n$ bits (i.e. a bit array), with $n$ specified at construction time. Apart from space taken by a reasonably small number of member variables, instances of the `BitArray` class should use at most $n + 63$ bits of memory and support setting and getting bits in constant time.\n",
    "* Support a function called `sum` on an instance of your `BitArray` class. The sum function should return the number of $1$ bits (i.e. bits that are equal to $1$) that appear in the `BitArray` up to a specified position. The extra space used for supporting sum (in addition to that required for the instance of `BitArray`) should be at most `n + 63` bits and the function should return an answer to `sum` in constant time. For this task, you may assume that the bits in the instance of `BitArray` will not change. A suggested approach for `sum` is provided later in this document.\n",
    "* Support a function called `location` on an instance of your `BitArray` class. The `location` function should essentially return the location of the ith $1$ bit (i.e. `sum(location(i)) = i`). You may use up to $n + 63$ additional bits to support these location queries. For this task, you may assume that the bits in the instance of `BitArray` will not change. A suggested approach for location is provided later in this document.\n",
    "* Implement a `PackedIntegerArray` class, which supports a sequence (array) of fixed-width integers and routines for getting and setting those integers. The class has two construction parameters $k$ and $n$. The parameter $n$ specifies the number of integers in the sequence. The second parameter, $k \\leq 64$, specifies the width of each integer in the sequence: every integer stored in the packed integer array must be in the range $[0..2^k)$. Each integer can therefore be stored in $k$ bits. Both $n$ and $k$ are specified at construction time and may not be changed afterwards. Apart from space taken by a reasonably small number of member variables, instances of your `PackedIntegerArray` class should use at most `kn + 63` bits of memory and support getting and setting of integers in constant time."

    "Assuming the get function runs in constant time, the above method clearly takes O(i) time and uses no additional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, your solution to sum will take $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time (or, failing that, as close to constant time as you can get it), but you are allowed to use a small amount of extra space to achieve this. For the purposes of supporting sum, you may assume the contents of the bit array $B$ will not change after your sum support structure is computed. \n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested approach for supporting sum is to store partial answers to `sum` queries at evenly-spaced points in the bit array $B$. Let $t$ be the distance (spacing) between the partial answers. The idea is to precompute and store the answers for `sum(t)`, `sum(2*t)`, `sum(3*t)`, and so on. In total we will have (about) `n/t` precomputed answers (stored in an array).\n",
    "\n",

    "This way, sum takes $\\mathcal{O(t)}$ time.

Look these routines up online, understand what they do, and integrate them into your solution.\n",

    "We now want to effectively query the locations of the 1 bits in the bit array.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the indexing here is a bit tricky, and the output value may be 1 greater than you would intuitively expect. For `location(i)` the value we are looking for is the smallest value $j$ such that `sum(j) = i`. Now since the range of the `sum` query is half open, the value returned by the location query needs to be one larger than may intuitively make sense. These are implementation details and may equally as well be done in a different way, but since CSES does automated testing, the indexing needs to be inline with the “model solutions”.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since `sum()` and `location()` are monotonic functions over the `BitArray`, and the values for `location()` can be calculated based on `sum()` queries, the results of `location()` can be calculated using binary search and `sum()`. This is fairly straightforward to implement and takes $\\mathcal{O}\\log(m)$ time but no extra space.\n",
